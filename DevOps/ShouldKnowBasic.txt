1. Operating Systems and Networking:
Linux: Proficiency in Linux is crucial as most servers and cloud environments run on it.
Networking basics: Understanding concepts like IP addresses, DNS, firewalls, and protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS).
Shell scripting: Bash, PowerShell, or another shell for automation tasks.

2. Version Control:
Git: Learn Git for source code management and collaboration. Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are important.

3. Scripting and Programming Languages:
Python or Go: These are popular in DevOps for automation, building custom tools, and scripting.
YAML/JSON: Used for configuration management in tools like Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform.

4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Terraform: For managing infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure) using code.
CloudFormation (if working on AWS).

5. Containers and Container Orchestration:
Docker: Learn how to build, manage, and troubleshoot containerized applications.
Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform to manage multiple containers in production environments.
Helm: Package manager for Kubernetes.

6. CI/CD Tools:
Jenkins: Popular tool for continuous integration and deployment automation.
GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, TravisCI: Alternative tools for CI/CD pipelines.

7. Cloud Platforms:
AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure: Understand basic services like compute (EC2, VMs), storage (S3, GCS), and networking (VPC, subnets).
IAM (Identity and Access Management): Security concepts are important across cloud providers.

8. Configuration Management:
Ansible: For automating server configuration.
Puppet or Chef: Alternative tools for managing configurations across many servers.

9. Monitoring and Logging:
Prometheus & Grafana: For monitoring systems, alerting, and visualizing metrics.
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk: For log aggregation and analysis.

10. Security (DevSecOps):
Security basics: Learn about secure coding, access controls, encryption, and compliance.
Vault (HashiCorp): For secret management.

11. Collaboration and Agile Practices:
Jira, Trello, or other project management tools.
Agile/Scrum methodology for development processes.

Learning Path:
Start with Linux and basic networking.
Learn Git for version control and Python for scripting.
Explore Docker for containers, then move to Kubernetes.
Study cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, and practice Terraform for IaC.
Dive into CI/CD with Jenkins or GitLab CI.
