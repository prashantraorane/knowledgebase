Deployment Models: Get familiar with public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.
Major Providers: Study the leading cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

2. Networking and Security Foundations
Networking: Knowledge of IP addresses, DNS, VPNs, firewalls, and load balancers is crucial.
Security Basics: Learn about fundamental security principles like encryption, firewalls, access control, and identity management.
Linux/Windows Systems: Understanding both operating systems will help you in cloud administration and security.

3. Cloud-Specific Security Concepts
Identity and Access Management (IAM): Learn how access is managed in the cloud, including the principle of least privilege and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Data Security: Learn about data encryption (at rest and in transit), secure data storage, and data classification.
Threat Detection & Incident Response: Familiarize yourself with cloud-native security monitoring tools, such as AWS CloudTrail, Azure Security Center, and Google Cloud Security Command Center.
